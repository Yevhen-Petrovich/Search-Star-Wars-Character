# Search Star Wars Character

Utilizing the publicly available Star Wars API (https://swapi.dev/), this page allows a user to enter name of Star Wars character, and returns them information about this thing.

The character images are taken from the open api (https://miadil.github.io/starwars-api/)

To connect to the api I use (https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/axios/dist/axios.min.js)
